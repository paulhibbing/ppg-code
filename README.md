## What is this?

This is a series of code files that replicate the data processing and analysis of our paper on PPG and activity recognition.

The majority of code files (those with `.R` extension) are for the [R statistical programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/).
A few other files (those with `.m` extension) are for a language called [Octave](https://octave.org/download).
Both languages are available for free at the links provided.
Please note that the R code needs to be run through another program
called [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), which is also available for free.

If you're not familiar with git/GitHub, you can access the code locally on your machine by clicking the green "Code" button above,
then clicking "Download ZIP".
