## What is this?

This is a series of code files (except for `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md` -- those are other files) that
use open-access data to demonstrate PPG data processing and perform a sample analysis focused on activity recognition.

Most of the code files (those with `.R` extension) are for the [R statistical programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/).
A few of them (those with `.m` extension) are for a language called [Octave](https://octave.org/download).
Both languages are available for free at the links provided.
Please note that the R code needs to be run through another freely-available program
called [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

If you're not familiar with git/GitHub, the easiest way to access this code on your computer is by
clicking the green "Code" button above, then selecting "Download ZIP".
