## What is this?

This is a series of code files that replicate the data processing and analysis of our paper on PPG and activity recognition.

The majority of code files are for the R statistical programming language. A couple are for a language called Octave.
Both languages are available for free. Please note that the R code needs to be run through another program
called RStudio. It is also available for free.
